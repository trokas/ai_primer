# Project: Flatland

Task is slightly inspired by the book Flatland. You will have to classify images by 'calculating' number of corners a figure in that image has using deep learning.

Train set contains pictures of the following shapes: circles, triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons.

Tain set is quite big (200 MB) - [DOWNLOAD](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7gq578nj3k7rua6/flatland_train.pickle?dl=0).

For your submission create a new [github](https://github.com/) repo and upload code/notebooks and final model (.h5 file).


## Leaderboard

To add some gamification all submissions will end up in a leaderboard. Each model will be evaluated on two test sets - one which closely matches train set and slightly more advanced one which nature will be revealed at the end of the course.

Passing benchmarks:

| Grade | Hints | Test set (simple) | Test set (adv.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Simple NN | >70% | any |
| 6 | Simple NN | >75% | any |
| 7 | CNN | >80% | any |
| 8 | CNN | >85% | any |
| 9 | CNN | >90% | any |
| 10 | Transfer learning | >90% | >80% |
