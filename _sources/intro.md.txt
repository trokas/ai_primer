Welcome to AI primer course
============================

**THIS IS ONLY A SKETCH, COURSE WILL BE HELP ON 2ND SEMESTER OF 2020**

My main aim is to give you enough information so that you can start exploring field of AI on your own and maybe even start searching for DS role.
In essance we have only 4 main chapters to cover.

- Prior deep learning
    - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) - it’s a good tool to introduce both technical tools we will be working with aswell as giving us a glympse at unsupervised learning.
    - RF (Random Forests) - one of the first “silver bullets” out there. Our discussion will also cover Shannon’s work on entropy as it’s one of the key ingredients.
- Deep learning era
    - FCN (Fully Connected Networks) - we will build our own Perceptron from scratch, thus focusing on gradient descent and backprop on the way. By changing activation fuction logistic regression will be introduced and finally we will explore what a stack of layers (deep NN) can offer.
    - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) - even though different techniques come and go in deep learning world I strongly believe that CNN’s will be around for quite some time to come. We will use them not only for images, but also for time series prediction.

After these 4 main chapter complementary material regarding new advanves of deep learning will be presented (like LSTM’s and Transformers), but it will not be mandatory.
Also we will cover following toolset, which hopefully will be useful for your future projects:

- numpy (mainly in SVD and FCN lectures) - will help us store vectors, matrices and perform operations on them.
- matplotlib (in all lectures) - nice and simple plotting lib.
- pandas (mainly in RF lecture) - structured way of looking at tabular data.
- keras (FCN and CNN lectures) - simple deep learning library based on tensorflow.
- git (final project) - version control tool.

Toolset will be presented only in lectures, thus it’s up to you to learn them on your own if you do not plan to attend. There are a lot of resources, but I highly suggest to read intros in corresponding docs.
What to expect from a single lecture?

- There will be no clear distinction between theory and practice, thus you should have your PC ready for small assignments that you will encounter on the way.
- Most important material will be listed here, but during lectures you will hear and see a lot of complementary material.
- Each lecture will end with a list of resources (some of them mandatory). We will start a new lecture with a recap of what was done last time and discussion regarding mentioned resources in the hope to deepen understanding in the subject and inspire you to search for sources and publications yourself.
